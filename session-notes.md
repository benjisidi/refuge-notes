# The Refuge Campaign

## Session 1: 16/05/21

- Myra is working on her armour in her workshop when the wall suddenly caves in. A little while later, she awakens to find the fortress under attack...

- **Glasha** (the orc commander)'s tribal marks have been burned off and the gem allowing her to control the golem is attached to her skin. On closer inspection, *all* the orcs attacking the castle have had their marks removed too.

- Myra makes an ornate silver hammer to leave on Birkosk's tomb

- There's a military funeral held at the castle. Before she leaves, Myra writes a letter

- Yaboi takes Atlas' body back to Shaded Vale and asks Mellora (the sapling) to revive him. She won't/can't - she's against resurrection, and it seems like something is preventing her from becoming too involved. She says Atlas is in the domain of Pelor.
- The group decide to head North, from fort to fort, to try to find the renegade group of orcs
- The first fort we come to is run by an upper class twit. It is in a bad state of disrepair.
- Travelling through increasingly marshy land, we arrive at the second fort. There's no guards on the walls or lights we can see. As rain enters to scout, she sees three giant crocodiles sitting in the square...

## Session 2: 03/06/21

- We annihilate the crocodiles. They looked diseased somehow.
- Butchering one of them, we find that the spit glands they've been attacking us with seem to be new growths, that have been restricting their breathing.
- The mucus, bright blue, seems to be a powerful mutagen.
- **Gerry** is the sole survivor (slightly podgy balding brown haired man) of the fort. He's a bit of a coward.
- During her watch, Brigit spots a strange hooved creature retreating into the night
- In the morning, more crocs have shown up, and we sneak out the castle. Gerry says the diseased crocs have only shown up in the past few weeks.
- We make camp for the evening halfway to the 3rd border fort. Yaboi polymorphs Gerald into a crocodile as a prank, and Gerry runs off screaming. Before Leeroy and Loki can catch up with him, he falls into a pile of leeches and gets bitten.

## Session 3: 10/06/21

- Brigit and Yaboi go leech-hunting. Yaboi grabs one with his mage-hand, then manages to fill the sack by creating a ditch for them all to fall into.

- Yaboi manages to butcher some of them and creates jellied eel for dinner.

- During the night, Yaboi and Leeroy notice hooved amphibious creatures stalking around the outskirts of the camp. They seem to be stalking the party but not attacking for some reason.

- In the morning, Gerry's eye appears to be leaking blood a little. Brigit's lesser restoration shot appears not to have any effect, neither does Gerald's greater restoration.

- Rain inspects his eye with a magnifying glass and sees several tiny worms in his eye.

- The party depart with haste, only to arrive mid-morning to find the fortress in ruins

- There are statues of soldiers in the courtyard. A hastily scrawled note is stuffed into the hands of one of the soldiers.

  - > *Silver beasts attacked at night. We've taken our chances and headed north. If anyone finds this, don't stay here.*

- Brigit hasn't heard of "silver beasts" before. However, Gerald's greater restoration restores one of the soldiers **Sgt Merrin**, who reports being attacked by silver bull-like creature who had stinking green breath that petrified its victims.

- Merrin describes the tribe to the North as the **Stonebag**. He says there's been much more trouble with beasts than the Orcs.

-  The party continues North with haste and Merrin peels off to head to the northern fort. The rest of us head to the Orc camp.

- A large walled camp of bone and wood stands with a large fire in the middle, flying banners of seven squares in a vertical column. A smaller encampment of hide tents sits off to one side, much less heavily fortified.

- As we approach, an Orcish figure in a crimson, white trimmed robe stands outside the gates and talks to those on the parapet.

- > *Dura, why do you continue to resist? Please, this is pointless. Your chief is dead. You must return to the fold. Please, let me enter, it is cold out here.*
  >
  > *Only orcs may enter this, **Balogog**, and you gave up that name when you chose to follow that pretender.*
  >
  > *Dura, you have been infected with the **old lie**. We are not who we thought we were. Please, do not be obstinate. You must realise your position. Your clan is weakened, your chief will not return from the wild. Surely he is dead.*
  >
  > *You know not of what you speak betrayer! Return to your camp before my guard fill you with arrows!*

- Leeroy speaks to **Dura**, and using *message* tells her that we are no friends of Durz. Dura outwardly rebuffs us, but privately tells us to camp near the walls and that she'll contact us in the morning.

- During the night, the orcs carefully tend to purple torches scattered about the camp, that are apparently to keep away the silver beasts. In the middle of the night, Dura comes to talk to us.

- Dura describes how Durz has overturned the orc's natural way of life. The clans are supposed to be free to forge their own individual paths, not ruled by one leader and forced to act cohesively. Leeroy suggests we go find their missing clan leader, to restore some stability to the clan, as orcs are deserting to join Durz. She describes a **hydra**, that has been the cause of the tribe's monster problems (the corruption), and that the chief and 10 of their best warriors went to fight it.

- We agree to fetch the chief, and in return Gerry will stay with the orcs and have his parasites tended to. Dura calls the beasts Gorgons, as we hear them approaching. Somebody dispels *Leomund's Tiny Hut* and we prepare to fight...
