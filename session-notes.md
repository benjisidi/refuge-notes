# The Refuge Campaign

## Session 1: 16/05/21

- Myra is working on her armour in her workshop when the wall suddenly caves in. A little while later, she awakens to find the fortress under attack...

- **Glasha** (the orc commander)'s tribal marks have been burned off and the gem allowing her to control the golem is attached to her skin. On closer inspection, *all* the orcs attacking the castle have had their marks removed too.

- Myra makes an ornate silver hammer to leave on Birkosk's tomb

- There's a military funeral held at the castle. Before she leaves, Myra writes a letter

- Yaboi takes Atlas' body back to Shaded Vale and asks Mellora (the sapling) to revive him. She won't/can't - she's against resurrection, and it seems like something is preventing her from becoming too involved. She says Atlas is in the domain of Pelor.
- The group decide to head North, from fort to fort, to try to find the renegade group of orcs
- The first fort we come to is run by an upper class twit. It is in a bad state of disrepair.
- Travelling through increasingly marshy land, we arrive at the second fort. There's no guards on the walls or lights we can see. As rain enters to scout, she sees three giant crocodiles sitting in the square...

## Session 2: 03/06/21

- We annihilate the crocodiles. They looked diseased somehow.
- Butchering one of them, we find that the spit glands they've been attacking us with seem to be new growths, that have been restricting their breathing.
- The mucus, bright blue, seems to be a powerful mutagen.
- **Gerry** is the sole survivor (slightly podgy balding brown haired man) of the fort. He's a bit of a coward.
- During her watch, Brigit spots a strange hooved creature retreating into the night
- In the morning, more crocs have shown up, and we sneak out the castle. Gerry says the diseased crocs have only shown up in the past few weeks.
- We make camp for the evening halfway to the 3rd border fort. Yaboi polymorphs Gerald into a crocodile as a prank, and Gerry runs off screaming. Before Leeroy and Loki can catch up with him, he falls into a pile of leeches and gets bitten.

## Session 3: 10/06/21

- Brigit and Yaboi go leech-hunting. Yaboi grabs one with his mage-hand, then manages to fill the sack by creating a ditch for them all to fall into.

- Yaboi manages to butcher some of them and creates jellied eel for dinner.

- During the night, Yaboi and Leeroy notice hooved amphibious creatures stalking around the outskirts of the camp. They seem to be stalking the party but not attacking for some reason.

- In the morning, Gerry's eye appears to be leaking blood a little. Brigit's lesser restoration shot appears not to have any effect, neither does Gerald's greater restoration.

- Rain inspects his eye with a magnifying glass and sees several tiny worms in his eye.

- The party depart with haste, only to arrive mid-morning to find the fortress in ruins

- There are statues of soldiers in the courtyard. A hastily scrawled note is stuffed into the hands of one of the soldiers.

  - > *Silver beasts attacked at night. We've taken our chances and headed north. If anyone finds this, don't stay here.*

- Brigit hasn't heard of "silver beasts" before. However, Gerald's greater restoration restores one of the soldiers **Sgt Merrin**, who reports being attacked by silver bull-like creature who had stinking green breath that petrified its victims.

- Merrin describes the tribe to the North as the **Stoneback**. He says there's been much more trouble with beasts than the Orcs.

-  The party continues North with haste and Merrin peels off to head to the northern fort. The rest of us head to the Orc camp.

- A large walled camp of bone and wood stands with a large fire in the middle, flying banners of seven squares in a vertical column. A smaller encampment of hide tents sits off to one side, much less heavily fortified.

- As we approach, an Orcish figure in a crimson, white trimmed robe stands outside the gates and talks to those on the parapet.

- > *Dura, why do you continue to resist? Please, this is pointless. Your chief is dead. You must return to the fold. Please, let me enter, it is cold out here.*
  >
  > *Only orcs may enter this, **Balogog**, and you gave up that name when you chose to follow that pretender.*
  >
  > *Dura, you have been infected with the **old lie**. We are not who we thought we were. Please, do not be obstinate. You must realise your position. Your clan is weakened, your chief will not return from the wild. Surely he is dead.*
  >
  > *You know not of what you speak betrayer! Return to your camp before my guard fill you with arrows!*

- Leeroy speaks to **Dura**, and using *message* tells her that we are no friends of Durz. Dura outwardly rebuffs us, but privately tells us to camp near the walls and that she'll contact us in the morning.

- During the night, the orcs carefully tend to purple torches scattered about the camp, that are apparently to keep away the silver beasts. In the middle of the night, Dura comes to talk to us.

- Dura describes how Durz has overturned the orc's natural way of life. The clans are supposed to be free to forge their own individual paths, not ruled by one leader and forced to act cohesively. Leeroy suggests we go find their missing clan leader, to restore some stability to the clan, as orcs are deserting to join Durz. She describes a **hydra**, that has been the cause of the tribe's monster problems (the corruption), and that the chief and 10 of their best warriors went to fight it.

- We agree to fetch the chief, and in return Gerry will stay with the orcs and have his parasites tended to. Dura calls the beasts Gorgons, as we hear them approaching. Somebody dispels *Leomund's Tiny Hut* and we prepare to fight...

## Session 4: 29/06/21

- We defeat the Gorgons by banishing two of them, and fighting them two at a time. After the fight Dura gives us permission to rest in the safety of Stoneback.
- The clan seems to be doing badly - the morale in the camp is poor, people look hungry and uncertain.
- Jura invites us into her hut. There's a cocktail of strong pungent smells in the air. A calf is part-way butchered against one side, and an array of herbs and spices sits nearby. 
- She gives Rain some *Krawgug* to help with the after-effects of *Haste*. It puts off tiredness and provides a temporary energy boost (~1hr). Won't help with exhaustion though. She also shows us a berry that we can use to turn a flame cool and purple - it repels the monsters corrupted by the hydra, but won't damage them.
- Dura tells us Balogog was sent to convince the tribe to join Durz. His army's path will take him right to the tribe's camp, and they'll be destroyed when he arrives unless they leave.
- Durz marched in and sacked the **Green Pillars** and unearthed the maintainers from there - the Stoneback see this as sacrilege and have refused to join him as a result, as have the shamans.
- In the Refuge histories, orcs are only really ever mentioned in passing as invaders. According to Dura, previous orcish invasions have been unsuccessful due to the Refuge's magical proficiency - in particular the gigantic manned suits of armour that defend the city.
- The orcs see everyone in the refuge as invaders. When Lion brought the Eastern races to the peninsula from the calamity, they drove the orcs and others West. The soil in the East is much more fertile - it's easier to develop large settlements there as a result. Eking out a living in the West is a hard life. 
- After they were pushed West, the orcs built a citadel at the foot of the mountains near Coldhome. **Gruumsh One-Eye**, god of orcs brought an earthquake and sank the city, as punishment for straying from the orcish way.
- At that time, many orc warriors fought over possession of a symbol of strength - a crown - that sank with the city. If a strong orc wearing Gruumsh's crown were to challenge Durz, he likely could not ignore it. Our plan is to find **Mugaroz**, the missing chief, and retrieve the crown for him.
- Yaboi suggests if we can make Durz look weak, it might cause him to lose support. Dura says four things make orcs cowards:
  - Refusing a challenge from an equal. Can refuse from lessers without penalty.
  - Killing using ambush/guerrilla tactics. Fighting should be done face to face.
  - If a challenge is lost, it is tradition to take the loser slave for a year. There is honour in this. Killing a slave is most dishonourable. Killing prisoners. This is most dishonourable.
  - Having a champion fight in your stead.  This rule is complicated - if you have a good track record of winning fights, sometimes it is ok to use a subordinate. 
- Dura agrees to remove Jerry's *eye-rot* as an act of good faith. We leave the tent to rest while she does.
