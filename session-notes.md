# The Refuge Campaign

## Session 1: 16/05/21

- Myra is working on her armour in her workshop when the wall suddenly caves in. A little while later, she awakens to find the fortress under attack...

- **Glasha** (the orc commander)'s tribal marks have been burned off and the gem allowing her to control the golem is attached to her skin. On closer inspection, *all* the orcs attacking the castle have had their marks removed too.

- Myra makes an ornate silver hammer to leave on Birkosk's tomb

- There's a military funeral held at the castle. Before she leaves, Myra writes a letter

  > Dear Ellie,
  >
  > I've had to drop everything and move again. The person who took me in was killed, my workshop's wrecked, and there's nothing keeping me here any more. 

- Yaboi takes Atlas' body back to Shaded Vale and asks Mellora (the sapling) to revive him. She won't/can't - she's against resurrection, and it seems like something is preventing her from becoming too involved. She says Atlas is in the domain of Pelor.
- The group decide to head North, from fort to fort, to try to find the renegade group of orcs
- The first fort we come to is run by an upper class twit. It is in a bad state of disrepair.
- Travelling through increasingly marshy land, we arrive at the second fort. There's no guards on the walls or lights we can see. As rain enters to scout, she sees three giant crocodiles sitting in the square...

## Session 2: 03/06/21

- We annihilate the crocodiles. They looked diseased somehow.
- Butchering one of them, we find that the spit glands they've been attacking us with seem to be new growths, that have been restricting their breathing.
- The mucus, bright blue, seems to be a powerful mutagen.
- **Gerry** is the sole survivor (slightly podgy balding brown haired man) of the fort. He's a bit of a coward.
- In the morning, more crocs have shown up, and we sneak out the castle. Gerry says the diseased crocs have only shown up in the past few weeks.
- We make camp for the evening halfway to the 3rd border fort. Yaboi polymorphs Gerald into a crocodile as a prank, and Gerry runs off screaming. Before Leeroy and Loki can catch up with him, he falls into a pile of leeches and gets bitten.
